# PDF Query Tool - A Proof of Concept Using SmolAgents ðŸš€

This project demonstrates the power of **SmolAgents**, a library designed to simplify the integration of intelligent agents into everyday workflows

## Features
- **Upload PDFs**: Extract text from uploaded PDF files for querying.
- **Direct Text Input**: Write or paste text directly to interact with the tool.
- **Dynamic Reasoning**: Ask questions in natural language, and the tool uses the SmolAgents framework to provide answers.
- **Custom Reasoning Steps**: Configure the number of reasoning steps (`max_iterations`) for the agent to control the complexity of its thought process.
